# hello-world
My first repository

Hello! I am completelt new to this. But I am pushing myself to learn as much as I can.

The thing that many do not know, is that I not only have to deal with work while studying, but I also have depression, anxiety and eating problems... So yeah, I deal with what I can deal with.

Life is life. Relationship is life. The only thing I can do is to hold on and deal with whatever however I can.

P.S.TO SELF: Need to stop doing so much that I could not handle. Ya know that you get overwhelmed super easily...

P.S.S. Being brutally honest is my nature, so people will just have to deal with it. Understanding though, that I'm a nice person...lol
